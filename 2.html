  <p>And if your heart stops beating I'll be here wondering Did you get what you deserve? The ending of your life</p>
  <p>And if you get to heaven I'll be here waiting, babe Did you get what you deserve? The end, and if your life won't wait Then your heart can't take this</p>
  <p>Have you heard the news that you're dead? No one ever had much nice to say, I Think they never liked you anyway Oh, take me from the hospital bed Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned And wouldn't it be great if we were dead?</p>
